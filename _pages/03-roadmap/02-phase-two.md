      <h3>Q1, 2019</h3>
      <h4>Continued Funding</h4>
      <p>
        We are actively seeking additional funding to continue work on Roo. If you are interested in funding opportunities or have suggestions, you can send them to <a href="mailto:info@helloroo.org">info@helloroo.org</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Future Features Design</h4>
      <p>
        We are excited about the future of conversational interfaces. With a rapidly growing ecosystem of advanced tools in AI and automation there are a great number of opportunities to expand Roo's functionality. We hope to explore these with more funding. 
      </p>

      <h3>Q2, 2019</h3>
      <h4>Public launch</h4>
      <p>
        Financial coaching organizations will be able to sign-up and use the Roo platform without requiring technical support from IDEO.org. Administrators can create accounts for their organizations and add coaches to their team. Coaches can create workplans and onboard a client to the bot. Exact features TBD according to what the development schedule allows (as described in <a href="/roadmap/phase-one/">Phase One</a>).
      </p>
      <h3>Q2 - Q3, 2019</h3>
      <h4>CRM Integration</h4>
      <p>
        If funding is granted, we hope to be able to support CRM integration. Records in Roo can be sync'd with records in an organization's database. Unfortunately, we will be unable to develop customized solutions for every organization. Instead, we will use data from Prosperity Now's network to determine the CRMs with the most usage across organizations and develop for those.
