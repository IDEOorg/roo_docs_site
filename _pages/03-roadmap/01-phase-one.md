        <h3>September, 2018 - March, 2019</h3>
        <h4>Continued Pilot</h4>
        <p>
            We are happy to announce that our pilot has been extended due to new development resources (see "About Andela" section below). We will be continuing to work with our existing partners, offering Roo to new clients of financial coaching. You can see the latest data summary by visiting our (quick and dirty) <a href="https://data.helloroo.org/" target="_blank">dashboard (best viewed on desktop).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            IDEO.org's funding to work on Roo officially ends October 1, 2018. We have reserved a couple hours a week and enough funds to cover the continued pilot, but no further design or research will take place after October 1st. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be seeking further funding to continue working on Roo. See sections below for more on our plans and dreams for what Roo could become. 
        </p>
        <h4>Development</h4>
        <p>All development will be tracked on our <a href="https://trello.com/b/l0egw1yL/roo-development-public" target="_blank">Trello board</a>. Follow along!</p>
        <p>
            Although IDEO.org's day-to-day work will cease on October 1, 2018, we have partnered with a development company (<a href="https://andela.com/" target="_blank">Andela</a> - see below for more) who has agreed to work on Roo free of charge. A member of IDEO.org will help manage the continued development of Roo with the partner to ensure continuity and quality.
        </p>
        <p>

            About Andela
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://andela.com/" target="_blank">Andela</a> is African software development company with offices in Lagos, Nairobi and Kampala. Their model includes an apprenticeship period for every new developer they hire. During this time, apprentices work on real-life projects alongside senior developers, of which Roo is one. Andela believes in the power of open-source software and is supportive of Roo for its social benefits. For these reasons and because of the experience it provides its new developers, Andela has generously offered to work on our feature list for no charge. 
        </p>
        <h4>Qualitative and Quantitative Impact Analysis</h4>
        <p>
           We will be conducting qualitative interviews with coaches and clients to gain insights on the user experience for both user types. For quantitative analysis, we have hired a data science team (<a href="https://www.bctpartners.com/" target="_blank">BCT Partners</a>) to cross-referencing the user data from Roo with client financial data from our partners.
        </p>
        <p>
           At the center of all our work on Roo are the following questions, which are part of our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yPq2xLPYSEOrjSDAR8XxCby0sPlJCJow/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">theory of change</a>.
